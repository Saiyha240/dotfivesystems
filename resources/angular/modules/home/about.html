                            Hi, my name is Mark! Short description about me, I'm a programmer who enjoys making web systems
                            that ease the troubles that life give us. When I was a student, I wasn't satisfied with topics
                            being discussed in my course. I then began studying how websites are created. After a while, I gained enough confidence to take on a project from a client. As things
                            led to another, so here I am, showing the world where my curiosity to learn has led me.
